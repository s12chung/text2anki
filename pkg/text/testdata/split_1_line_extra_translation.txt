내가 가는 이길이

===

The road that I’m taking
Where it’s leading me to, where it’s taking me
Or where the final destination is
I have no idea, no idea, no idea
Yet I’m still following this path today

Has destiny already been determined for everyone
Or is it that we have to make
Our own destiny
I have no idea, no idea, no idea
Yet I’m still taking another step towards the road

Why am I standing on this road
Is this path really destined for me
Would my dreams come true at the end of this road
